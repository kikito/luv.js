// This Luv.js example shows how to load and play a sound.
// Press any key (or mouse button) to play a "ding" sound.

// On the screen you will see now many instances of the sound there are
// on memory, and how many of them are playing. If you stop playing them,
// they will get discarded from memory after a while.

var luv = Luv();

var dingSound;

// Start loading the sound inside luv.load. Notice the two paths.
luv.load = function() {
  dingSound = luv.audio.Sound('sfx/ding.ogg', 'sfx/ding.mp3');
};

// This is one way to bind mouse and key presses to an action
// In this case, they play the sound (if it has been loaded)
luv.keyboard.onPressed = luv.mouse.onPressed = function() {
  if(!luv.media.isLoaded()) { return; }
  dingSound.play();
};

// luv.draw is used to display two simple text lines
luv.draw = function() {
  luv.graphics.print("Total Instances: " + dingSound.countInstances(), 100, 100);
  luv.graphics.print("Playing Instances: " + dingSound.countPlayingInstances(), 100, 150);
};

// As always, don't forget to invoke luv.run to start the game
luv.run();
