luv.js
======
A javascript/coffeescript html5 game library heavily inspired by [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org).

## Minimal example

The minimal example requires one two files: `luv.js` and `index.html`. You can download luv.js directly from this repository. Here's a sample html:

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>Basic luv.js example</title>
      <script src="luv.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <script>
        var luv = Luv();

        luv.draw = function() {
          luv.graphics.print("Hello, my luv", 200, 300);
        };

        luv.run();
      </script>
    </body>
    </html>
